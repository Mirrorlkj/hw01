## Reflection and Experience 
- **Problem 0:** no previous experience with any programming language, first study in an English enviornment. The process is the opposite of painless and takes me loooooooonger time to figure everything out.

- **Problem 1:** R punched me at the very beginning with an unreadale error message when I tried to push/pull. I installed every components but there was nothing in the upper right pane under git tab. Neither TA and teacher knew what was going on, just when I was thinking about using R cloud instead. My roommate suggested I could try to change the file name from chinese to english. Finally, I changed the computer system's priority language and it worked out !!!
